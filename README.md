# visualizeSquare
A web app that tests users on their chess board visualization.  [Heroku Link](https://marksman.herokuapp.com)

##MVP (reached)
- Users are prompted to guess 'light' or 'dark' for a chess board coordinate
- Users can quess by clicking 'light' or 'dark' buttons
- Users are told if they were correct or incorrect
- Users see an image of the last coordinate they guessed, showing them where the actual coordinate is on a chess board
- Coordinate prompts cycle through randomly and never stop

##Stretch (for next iteration)
- Users can see their results from their current session
- Users can see which squares they need more work on (which ones they get incorrect more times than correct)
