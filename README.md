# visualizeSquare
A web app that tests users on their chess board visualization.

##MVP
- Users are prompted to guess 'white' or 'black' for a chess board coordinate
- Users can click 'white' or 'black' buttons 
- Users are told if they were correct or incorrect
- Coordinate prompts cycle through randomly and never stop

##Stretch
- Users can see their results from their current session
- Users can see which squares they need more work on (which ones they get incorrect more times than correct)
